# movehqtest

Cypress test logic for contact form
Make sure you have node or yarn installed on your machine (yarn script is not implemented since the majority of users use NPM)
Tests are located in /cypress/e2e/**.cy.ts folder
How to run my test :

1. Run git pull so you are up to date with master branch
2. Run npm i
3. Run npm run cypress:open:movehq
4. Open contact-form.cy.ts

Thank you
